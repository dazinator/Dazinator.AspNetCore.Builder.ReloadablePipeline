            // Hot path: is to await an already completed task (if pipeline has been built which is normal case) as there is no work to be done.
            //           - Note: i'm very much hoping that awaiting a completed task is optimised by the runtime for basically no overhead..?
            // Cool path: The task returned represents some work that needs to be done to build the pipeline in line with this request (if using such an IRebuildStrategy)
            //           - Note: I'm then relying on the fact that this request (and any concurrent request that has reached here) will asynchronously await the same task,
            //           which should result in the task only running once - and its result being made available to all concurrent callers. This avoids having to explicitly place any lock around the rebuild operation.
